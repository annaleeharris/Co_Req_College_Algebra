#### Targeted Infusion Project: Infusion of Coding in Julia, WebAssign, and Peer-Led Team Learning to Enhance Minority STEM Majors’ Mathematics Performance (NSF HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project grant (#1818440) and Julia Computing Awards Diversity and Inclusion Grants Funded by Sloan Foundation )
Mathematics is an important foundation of every science. Strong mathematical skills are the gateway to productive interdisciplinary exchanges in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The two largest STEM majors at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) are Biology and Nursing/Pre-Nursing. These two majors are studied by 55% of UAPB STEM students, who are required to take College Algebra as one of their core requirements. The current failing rate of College Algebra at UAPB is 35.33%, which is similar to the failing rate at most Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Furthermore, the College Algebra failing rate at UAPB has increased each year since Spring 2015 (Spring 2015: 33%, Spring 2016: 34%, and Spring 2017: 39%). The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) offers 7 or 8 sections with 30 or more students per section every semester, which means each year there are about 150 STEM students (425 students x 0.3533 ~ 150 students) in danger of leaving STEM fields due to poor Mathematics performance. College Algebra is one of the major bottleneck courses for many STEM students at UAPB, especially incoming first-generation minority STEM students. 

Many MCS faculty members understand the advantages of evidence-based active learning and teaching but are hesitant to embrace such teaching methods due to the lack of supporting materials and proper training. Through NSF HBUC-UP TIP grant and Julia Computing Awards Diversity and Inclusion Grants Funded by Sloan Foundation MCS faculty implemented evidence-based instructions. We developed new course materials utilizing Julia coding and updated current course materials to enhance teaching and learning Mathematics. 

The goal of this project is to infuse coding in Julia, WebAssign and peer-led team (PLT) learning to enhance minority STEM majors’ Mathematics performance. 
In order to enhance minority STEM majors’ Mathematics performance, we implemented the following activities: 
1) Developed faculty expertise in evidence-based instructional pedagogies by attending on-campus training workshops and external conferences; 
2) Piloted evidence-based instructions (EBIs) in College Algebra and co-requisite College Algebra classes; 
3) Developed a co-requisite College Algebra class and updated course curriculum incorporating EBIs materials and activities; 
4) Developed a comprehensive communal mathematics learning center for implementing evidence-based learning activities; and 
5) Trained and mentored peer-led-team-leaders (PLTLs).

Through NSF HBUC-UP TIP grant and Julia Computing Awards Diversity and Inclusion Grants Funded by Sloan Foundation participating UAPB students, particularly underrepresented minority and women undergraduate students, achieved deeper understanding of Mathematics and enhance their research and technology abilities, leading these STEM students to be successful in their disciplines and to an increase in STEM retention and graduation rates. 

This project addressed the nation’s dire shortage of a qualified STEM workforce, specially a minority STEM workforce. This project’s activities can be disseminated to other institutions to increase their STEM retention and graduation rates.
